## Demo

## Usage

The analog clock will automatically start displaying the current time once you open the `index.html` file in your browser. The hour, minute, and second hands will move accordingly to show the real-time.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the clock:

- **Clock Size**: Adjust the size of the clock in the CSS file to fit your design requirements.
- **Clock Hands**: Modify the appearance of the hour, minute, and second hands using CSS styles.
- **Color Scheme**: Change the colors of the clock hands and clock face according to your preference.
- **Mode Options**: Can be Changed to Dark And Light Mode.

Feel free to experiment with the code and make it your own!
